BiggestDiff method is a method that is used to:
find the difference between the two types of camera and then which brand sports the biggest differene
it does this by first looping through the main 2d array and populatiing a temp array that holds the differences
thereafter it loops throught that array anduses a temp value to determine the biggest number, once it does that it commits
a int val to memory, this value is the position of this difference in the array which corresponds to the brand as they are linked
