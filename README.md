This method is used to make sure the users age is a string, by utilizing a try catch method
it attempts to convert the string user age, into an int. if it fails, the catch outputs so, causing it to loop as
the method is run in a while loop

validAge method:
this method uses a simlar principle as above, if the users age is =>16, then it returns a true, allowing the program to move along
